This project is work in progress...

# 1pass
GUI for [1password cli](https://support.1password.com/command-line-getting-started/)  
Since linux doesn't have a 1password client, this is a simple way to access passwords in 1password

# Build
You need to install [qt](https://github.com/therecipe/qt/wiki/Installation) for go first.
You can find [building instructions](https://github.com/therecipe/qt/wiki/Getting-Started#starting-application) for qt applications too.

NOTE: only tested on linux with qt5.8 and go1.9 atm
